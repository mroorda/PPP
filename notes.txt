Folder root has constants: receptor and SAM positioned which is needed for smina docking box alignment

ligand and receptor folders are intended to temporarily contain ligands and results, these are transferred a level up to ligand and result folders after docking

run.zsh runs the docking in mass

essentially:
dump prepared ligands in the ligands folder
run the script
drink coffee
reap the results
clean up
